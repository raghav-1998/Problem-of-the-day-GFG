**Count Binary Strings With No Consecutive 1s** ==>

Given an integer N. Your task is to find the number of binary strings of length N having no consecutive 1s.
As the number can be large, return the answer modulo 10^9+7

**Example 1**:

Input: N = 3

Output: 5

Explanation: All the binary strings of length 3 having no consecutive 1s are "000", "001", "101", "100" and "010".

**Example 2**:

Input:  N = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: All the binary strings of length 2 having no consecutive 1s are "10", "00" and "01"

**Your Task**:

You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function countStrings() which takes the integer N as the input parameter, and returns the number of binary strings of length N with no consecutive 1s.

**Expected Time Complexity**: O(log(N))

**Expected Auxiliary Space**: O(Height of the recursive call stack)

**Constraints**: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18
