**Cutting Binary String** ==>

Given a string s containing 0's and 1's. You have to return the smallest positive integer C, such that the binary string can be cut into C pieces and each piece should be of the power of 5  with no leading zeros.
Note: The string s is a binary string. And if no such cuts are possible, then return -1.

**Example 1**:

Input: s = "101101101"

Output: 3

Explanation: We can split the given string into three 101s, where 101 is the binary representation of 5.

**Example 2**:

Input:s = "00000"

Output: -1

Explanation: 0 is not a power of 5.

**Your Task**:
Your task is to complete the function cuts() which take a single argument(string s). You need not take any input or print anything. Return an int C if the cut is possible else return -1.

**Expected Time Complexity**: O(|s|*|s|*|s|).

**Expected Auxiliary Space**: O(|s|).

**Constraints**:
1<= |s| <=50
