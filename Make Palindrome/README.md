**Make Palindrome** ==>

You are given an array of strings arr of size n. You have to find out if it is possible to make a palindromic string by concatenating all the strings in any order. Provided that all the strings given in the array are of equal length.

**Example 1**:

Input: n = 4 arr = {"djfh", "gadt", "hfjd", "tdag"}

Output: YES

Explanation: You can make the string "djfhgadttdaghfjd", by concatenating the given strings which is a palindrome.

**Example 2**: 

Input: n = 3 arr = {"jhjdf", "sftas", "fgsdf"}

Output: NO

Explanation: You can't make a palindromic string with this strings.

**Your Task**:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function makePalindrome() which takes an integer n and an array of strings arr respectively and returns true or false.

**Expected Time Complexity**: O(n * len(arr[i]))
**Expected Space Complexity**: O(n * len(arr[i]))

**Constraints**:
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- 0 <= |arr[i]| <= 1064
- The sum of n*|arr[i]| over all test cases won't exceed 10^6
